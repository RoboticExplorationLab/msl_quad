### CAD Environment

* Solidworks 2016
* main assembly file: quadrotor.SLDASM

### 3D printing

* We used Ultimaker 2+

* For the sake of quality, consider slowing down the print speed, especially for large parts

* Use brim (at leat 5mm is recommended) in Cura to enhance adhesion to the print bed.
